          <p>Routedux routes URLs to Redux actions and vice versa.</p>
          <p>
            Your application doesn't need to know it lives in a browser, but
            your users want pretty urls and deep links.
          </p>
          <section>
            <h2>
              Wait, my application doesn't need to know it lives in a browser?
            </h2>
            <p>
              URLs are great for finding things on the internet. But a single
              page application is not the same as a collection of resources that
              lives on a remote server.
            </p>
            <p>
              A single page application is a web application only in the sense
              that it lives on the web. URLs are are not essential to it working
              well.
            </p>
            <p>
              URLs give users accessing your application in a browser the
              ability to bookmark a particular view in your application so that
              their expectation of browser-based applications will continue to
              work.
            </p>
            <p>
              We think that's a good thing, but we also don't think the idea of
              url paths should be littered through your application.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you are developing a redux application, you want your UI to
              be a pure function of the current state tree.
            </p>
            <p>
              By adding routes to that, it makes it harder to test. And this
              difficulty can be compounded by other decisions about how to add
              routes to your application.

            <h2>An alternative approach</h2>
            <p>
              React Router is the currently-accepted way to do URL routing in
              React applications. For a standard React application without
              Redux, this solution isn't too bad. But once you add Redux, things
              get difficult.
            </p>
            <p>
              We basically discovered the same lessons as Formidable
              Labs:<splice-me
                ><label
                  for="REACTROUTERWRONG"

                ><input
                  id="REACTROUTERWRONG"
                  class="margin-toggle"
                  type="checkbox"
                /><span class="sidenote"
                  ><a
                    href="http://formidable.com/blog/2016/07/11/let-the-url-do-the-talking-part-1-the-pain-of-react-router-in-redux/"

                  ></span
                ></splice-me
              >
              However, we don't think their solution (<a
                href="https://github.com/FormidableLabs/redux-little-router"
                >redux-little-router</a
              >) goes far enough, as it still embeds the idea of routes
              throughout your user interface.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you separate URLs from your application state, you can easily
              port it to other environments that don't know what URLs are, and
              by simply removing the routing declaration, things will work as
              before.
            </p>
            <p>
              As an added (and we think absolutely essential) benefit, your
              entire application becomes easier to test, as rendering is a pure
              function of Redux state, and model logic and route actions are
              entirely encapsulated in Redux outside of the app.

            <h2>Route matching precedence - which route matches best?</h2>
            <p>
              Route precedence is a function of the type of matching done in
              each segment and the order in which the wildcard segments match.
              Exact matches are always preferred to wildcards moving from left
              to right.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">const routesInOrderOfPrecedence = [
  ['/user/me/update', '/user/me'], // both perfectly specific - will match above any wildcard route
  '/user/me/:view',
  '/user/:id/update', // less specific because 'me' is exact match, while :id is a wildcard
  '/user/:id/:view'
];</code></pre>

            <h2>Fragment component</h2>
            <p>
              Given that every UI state will be in your state tree as a function
              of your reducer logic, you can express any restriction on which
              parts of the UI display, even those that have nothing to do with
              the specific transformations caused by your URL actions.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript"><p>const state = {
  menu: ...
}</p><p>const view = (
  &lt;PageFrame&gt;
      &lt;Fragment state={state} filterOn="menu"&gt;
        &lt;Menu /&gt;
      &lt;/Fragment&gt;

(

            <h2>ActionLink and pathForAction(action)</h2>
            <p>
              Occasionally it is nice to render URLs inside of your application.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a convenience, we have attached
              <code class="javascript">pathForAction</code> to the
              <code class="javascript">store</code> object, which uses the same
              matcher that the action matcher uses. This allows you to create
              links in your application by using the actions.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript"><p>const routesConfig = [
  ['/user/:id', LOAD_USER, {}],
  ['/user/me', LOAD_USER, {id: currentUserId()}]
];
/* ... do store initialization */</p><p>store.pathForAction({type:LOAD_USER, id: currentUserId()});
/* returns /user/me */</p><p>/* ActionLink */</p><p>import { ActionLink as _ActionLink } from "routedux";</p><p>const store = createStore(...);</p><p>class ActionLink extends _ActionLink {
    constructor(props) {
        super({ ...props });
        this.store = store;
    }
}</p><p>const action = {
  type: LOAD_USER,
  id: 123
};</p><p>return (
  &lt;ActionLink action={action}&gt;Link Text&lt;/ActionLink&gt;
);</p><p>/* renders as a link to &lt;a href="/usr/123"&gt;Link Text&lt;/a&gt; with the text */</p></code></pre>
          </section>
          <p>
            Now you have links, but your links always stay up to date with your
            routing configuration.
